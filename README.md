# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting firm that develops financial plans tailored to their customers. We were hired to develop a web application and secure it so they could manage personal client data.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was able to identify vulnerabilities using static testing in the codebase. Secure code is critical to prevent theft of user data, especially when the data is PII or sensitive financial iformation.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The dependency checks were incredibly useful, allowing me to run the entire codebase against known attack vectors to know where updates and tweaks were needed.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In the future, I would run a red team of penetration testers to stress-test the security of the system. They would provide a report detailing their findings so we could implement changes to the code and employee policies to increase security.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
If new dependencies were added, I would re-run the dependency check. Manual code reviews are also useful when making changes to prevent vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Using resources such as coding related subreddits, stackoverflow, and hack forums can provide valuable information and insight from fellow programmers and industry professionals.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them the Project Two code base and the accompanying report to detail how the dependency checks were done and how they were implemented.
